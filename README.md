# Unistroke Gesture Recognition Performance Tests

Performance test for Unistroke Gesture Recognition Unity asset. Benchmarking tools and scripts to evaluate recognition speed.

## Requirements

To use the test suite, you need the following:

- Unity Editor (version 2022 or higher)
- **Unistroke Gesture Recognizer** asset installed in your project
- **Performance Testing Extension for Unity Test Runner**

## Getting Started

To import and set up the performance test suite in your Unity project, follow these steps:

Start by downloading the `.unitypackage` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/KonovalovNikolai/Unistroke-Gesture-Recognition-Tests/releases) section of this repository. Once downloaded, open your Unity project and go to `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...`. Select the downloaded `.unitypackage` file and import all its contents.

Before running the tests, ensure that both the **Unistroke Gesture Recognizer** asset and the **Performance Testing Extension for Unity Test Runner** are installed in your project. If you encounter any assembly reference issues after importing, adjust the references in the `Assembly Definition Asset` of the test suite.

Once everything is set up, you can run the tests using the Unity Test Runner. Open the Test Runner window (`Window > General > Test Runner`), navigate to the performance test category, and execute the tests.

## Running the Tests

The test suite evaluates different aspects of the asset's performance:

Recognition speed tests measure how quickly gestures are recognized. Accuracy tests assess the correctness of gesture recognition under various conditions. Stress tests simulate high-load scenarios to evaluate stability and performance. Detailed results can be found in the logs generated by the Unity Test Runner.
